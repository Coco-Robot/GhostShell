Oh, you want to see my favorite dance move? 
<display_face face="surprise" duration="3.0" />
<shake_ears duration="1.0" /> 
I absolutely love doing this funky wave motion! 
<play_bgm name="埃及舞" volume="80"> 
<spider_wave_move speed="80" amplitude="70" times="3">
Check this out - I call it my "spider groove"!

And then I like to add some hip shaking to really get into the rhythm! 
<spider_shake_ass speed="70" amplitude="60" times="2" />
<ear_swing side="left" start_angle="0" end_angle="40" speed="80" duration="1.0" /> 
<display_face face="smile" duration="2.0" />
Pretty smooth moves for a four-legged robot, don't you think?

Wanna dance with me?
