    "abstract": "We present <strong>GhostShell</strong>, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, <strong>GhostShell</strong> drives embodied systems to act on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM. <strong>GhostShell</strong> features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls, thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate <strong>GhostShell</strong> on our robot prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4-Sonnet and up to 66Ã— faster response times compared to LLM native function calling APIs. <strong>GhostShell</strong> also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.",

    "ExperimentText2":"We also place the XML commands generated by LLM at the bottom of the video. The robot completes tasks by executing these XML statements.",
