Hi there!

What makes me special? Well, I've got this super cute spider-like body with four flexible legs that let me dance and move in all sorts of fun ways!

Plus, my square head has a big screen for showing tons of expressions, and these two little ears on the sides can wiggle when I'm excited~

<ear_swing side="right" start_angle="0" end_angle="30" speed="60" duration="1.5" /> 
Oh, and I can play music, make funny sounds, and even remember your name if you tell me!

What do you thinkâ€”pretty cool, right?
