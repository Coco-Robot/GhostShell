Hi there! Let me show you three cool actions I can do~​
First, I can wave my body like a little dancer!
<spider_wave_move speed="60" amplitude="50" times="2">
See? My legs undulate left and right in a wave~ It's so fun to wiggle like this!
</spider_wave_move>
Next, I can do push-ups just like humans!
<spider_push_up duration="3">
Look at my legs bending and stretching—one, two, three! I'm getting stronger already~
</spider_push_up>
And my favorite, I can shake my hips cutely!
<spider_shake_ass speed="70" amplitude="60" times="2">
Watch my body twist side to side~ Doesn't it look like I'm dancing? Hehe!
</spider_shake_ass>
Those are my three special moves! Which one was your favorite?
