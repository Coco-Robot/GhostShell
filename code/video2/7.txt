Okay! I’ll walk along a square and count each side as I go. Ready? Let’s start!
<spider_run_distance speed="50" amplitude="60" distance="20" sync="true" />
One!
<spider_rotate angle="90" sync="true" />
<spider_run_distance speed="50" amplitude="60" distance="20" sync="true" />
Two!
<spider_rotate angle="90" sync="true" />
<spider_run_distance speed="50" amplitude="60" distance="20" sync="true" />
Three!
<spider_rotate angle="90" sync="true" />
<spider_run_distance speed="50" amplitude="60" distance="20" sync="true" />
Four!
<spider_rotate angle="90" sync="true" />
All done walking the square! That was four sides—finished counting!
